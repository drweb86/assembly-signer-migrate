1. Purpose

This tool is designed to sign unsigned assemblies(in compiled libraries) with specified key .snk file
This is a required task if when you deploy application you need to put assembly in GAC

2. Software requirements

Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0
Microsoft .Net Framework XX
Microsoft .Net XX SDK
Windows

XX - required version for signing assembly

3. Configuring of program

	1. With Reflector please open target assembly to sign and see Microsoft.Net version
	2. Open %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework of this version
	3. Open tool configuration file 'as.exe.config'
	
	3.1. First line in configuration file is a path of 'ilasm.exe' file:
	For example:
	%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v1.1.4322\ilasm.exe
	
	3.2. Second line in configuration file is a path of 'ildasm.exe' file from installed .Net SDK:
	For example:
	D:\SOFT_ARCHIVE\SDK 1.1 .NET\Bin\ildasm.exe
	
Tool tested on .Net 1.1

Remarks for putting assembly in GAC for .Net 1.1:
	Target assembly name should be the same as source name.
	So if you had
	c:\mySuperGeneratedAssembly.dll
	please leave it's name unmodified when specifying target file name
	c:\signed\mySuperGeneratedAssembly.dll
